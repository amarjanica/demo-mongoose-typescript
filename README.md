# Demo Mongoose Typescript

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/amarjanica/demo-mongoose-typescript/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/amarjanica/demo-mongoose-typescript/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Demo project that shows how you can configure Mongoose to use in Typescript:
- cache your connections
- unit test with mongodb-memory-server
- do geospatial and recursive queries
- publish a private npm package

Entire process is documented in blogpost [Working with Mongoose and Typescript](https://www.amarjanica.com/working-with-mongoose-typescript-and-gis).
